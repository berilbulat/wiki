is considered reliable. If these sources also publish materials online, then it is usually fair to assume that these materials have a similar publication process (see [[WP:NEWSBLOG]]).

Some very good films may not meet the standards of notability because they have not been broadly seen and reported on.  Such films are not suitable subjects for Wikipedia articles, as they have not yet been deemed \"notable\" by the society outside of our pages.  As much as film buffs enjoy seeking out hidden gems and obscure masterpieces, it is '''not''' the role of Wikipedia to help '''promote''' obscure films, or to comment on films that '''should be''' notable but aren't.  Such an approach would fail to fit the [[WP:NPOV|Neutral Point Of View]] policies of Wikipedia.  If a film has done the circuit of several international film festivals, but has failed to gather any critical notice by those who report on the festival scene, then it is not our purpose to conduct [[WP:NOR|Original Research]] and bring these films to light.  If you know of such a film, deserving of notice that it has so fair failed to attain, then please publish your report on this film in an appropriate film publication, before trying to use Wikipedia to publicize your find.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>Not all Wikipedia articles on notable films have so far asserted their notability, or provided verifiable sources for their information.
