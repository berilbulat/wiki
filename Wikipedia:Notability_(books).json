If, in such a case, the book cannot be merged only because the notable author's article, or the bibliography or list of books, does not currently exist, consider writing the author's article, or the bibliography or list, yourself or [[Wikipedia:Requested articles|request]] that it be written.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>==Resources==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*Clicking on any linked ISBN number on Wikipedia takes you to [[Special:Booksources]] where preformatted links for the specific book are provided, allowing access to multiple library catalogues, bookseller databases and other book resources.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>::This might be an issue as different formats of a book (i.e. ebook, audiobook, printed book) will have different ISBNs, and they will often not be sequential, especially for older books that were originally published before ebooks or audiobooks existed.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[British Library|The British Library's online catalogue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bl.uk/  |title=catalogue.bl.uk |publisher=catalogue.bl.uk |date=1994-11-06 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[Library of Congress|The Library of Congress Online Catalog]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/ |title=catalog.loc.gov |publisher=catalog.loc.gov |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a searchable database useful in identifying publisher, edition, etc.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|The Literary Encyclopedia]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/ |title=litencyc.com |publisher=litencyc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,300 profiles of authors, works and literary and historical topics and references of 18,000 works.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>*[[Norton Anthology|Norton anthology of world literature]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/nawol/ |title=Norton Anthology of World Literature: W.

They are often highly specialized, have small printing runs, and may only be available in specialized libraries and bookstores. For these reasons, most of the standards for mainstream books are inapplicable to the academic field because they would be too restrictive and would exclude articles on books that are worthy of notice. Again, common sense should prevail. In such cases, possible bases for a finding of notability include, in particular, whether the book is published by an academic press,&lt;ref&gt;Publication by a prominent academic press should be accorded far more weight than the analogous benchmark defined for publication of mainstream book by well known commercial publishers, by virtue of the ''non''-commercial nature of such presses, and the [[peer review]] process that some academic books must pass before publication is allowed to go forward.

Note that because a large portion of (en.)Wikipedia articles are written by English speaking people from English speaking nations, this list currently has an English speaking bias.&lt;/ref&gt; how widely the book is cited by other academic publications or in the media,&lt;ref&gt;A book's subject may be so specialized, such as in the esoteric math or physics spheres, that only a few hundred (or fewer) people in the world are situated to understand and comment on the material.&lt;/ref&gt; how influential the book is considered to be in its specialty area, or adjunct disciplines, and whether it is taught or required reading in a number of reputable educational institutions.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>==Derivative articles==</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>{{Shortcut|WP:BKD}}</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>It is a general consensus on Wikipedia that articles on books should not be split and split again into ever more minutiae of detail treatment, with each split normally lowering the level of notability. What this means is that while a book may be notable, it is not normally advisable to have a separate article on a character or thing from the book, and it is often the case that despite the book being manifestly notable, a derivative article from it is not. Exceptions do, of course, exist\u2014especially in the case of very famous books. For example few would argue that [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' does not warrant a 'subarticle' on its protagonist, [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

This narrative journey begins on August 18, 1955, the day that Hurricane Diane made its mark on the forks of the Delaware region of northwestern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania, and transports the reader to a time when infamous gangsters earned a living selling illegal liquor in speakeasies.

For example few would argue that [[Anthony Burgess]]' [[A Clockwork Orange]] does not warrant a 'subarticle' on its protagonist, [[Alex DeLarge]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>For more detailed guidelines regarding articles about fiction, see [[Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)]].</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>For more detailed guidelines regarding articles about fiction, see [[Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>==Resources==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*Clicking on any linked ISBN number on Wikipedia takes you to [[Special:Booksources]] where preformatted links for the specific book are provided, allowing access to multiple library catalogues, bookseller databases and other book resources.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*[http://catalog.loc.gov/ Library of Congress Online Catalog]: A searchable database useful in identifying publisher, edition, etc.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*[http://catalogue.bl.uk/ The British Library]'s online catalogue.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*[http://www.litencyc.com/ The Literary Encyclopedia]: 3300 profiles of authors, works and literary and historical topics and references of 18,000 works.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>*[http://www.wwnorton.com/nawol/ Norton anthology of world literature]: Useful in the exploration of world literature.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Notes ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Notes ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 53:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 60:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>* [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>* [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>* [[Wikipedia:Search engine test]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>* [[Wikipedia:Search engine test]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Category:Subject-specific notability criteria|Notability (books)]]</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>[[Category:Subject-specific notability criteria|Notability (books)]]</div></td>\n</tr>\n\n<!-- diff cache key enwiki:diff:wikidiff2:1.12:old-61506687:rev-61512799:1.10.0 -->\n", "touserid": 665998, "diffsize": 5493, "fromsize": 8179, "touser": "Fuhghettaboutit", "fromuser": "Fuhghettaboutit", "tosize": 8941}}, {"compare": {"fromuserid": 665998, "*": "<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 43:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 43:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>* {{fnb|1}}  Try not to apply ''guidelines'' reflexively; as if they are written in stone.
