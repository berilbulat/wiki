Deletion discussions while events are still hot news items rarely result in consensus to delete. There may be alternatives to deletion, such as merging or reworking the article so that it conforms with policy, for example, by rewriting an article about a person known only for one event to be about the event.

Similarly, where a single story or press release is simply re-reported (often word-for-word) by news publications, or when reporters base their information on repeating news coverage from elsewhere (for example, \"[[Associated Press|AP]] reported that&amp;nbsp;...\"), this should only be counted as a single source for the purpose of determining notability (see [[Wikipedia:Bombardment]]). Derivative reports and reports under common control cannot be used to verify each other, nor does mere repetition necessarily show the kind of effort that is good evidence of a significant matter.</div></td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Other circumstances ==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>== Other circumstances ==</div></td>\n</tr>\n", "touserid": 19202051, "diffsize": 20482, "fromsize": 21772, "touser": "Africamusicconference", "fromuser": "Africamusicconference", "tosize": 12247}}, {"compare": {"fromuserid": 921080, "*": "<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 9:</td>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-lineno\">Line 9:</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Background==</div></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-context\"><div>==Background==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>The Africa Music Conference  encompasses all genre of music with the aim of bringing together Artists, Music Producers, Recording Companies, Artist Managers, Songwriters, Sound Engineers, DJs, Music TV Channels, Radio Stations, etc. from all over Africa, America, Europe, Australia,  Canada etc., to talk about the African Music Industry, its potentials, its future, what it will take to move the African music industry forward.</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">\u2212</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-deletedline\"><div>[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion|Article deletion discussions]] have featured a number of contentious debates about events, particularly breaking news events, that have received intense media coverage.

A \"criminal act\" includes a matter in which a crime has been established, or a matter has been deemed a likely crime by the relevant law enforcement agency or judicial authority.  For example, the disappearance of a person would fall under this guideline if law enforcement agencies deemed it likely to have been caused by criminal conduct, regardless of whether a perpetrator is identified or charged.  If a matter is deemed notable, and to be a likely crime, the article should remain even if it is subsequently found that no crime occurred (e.g., the [[Runaway bride case]]) since that would not make the matter less notable. Intense media coverage can confer notability on a high-profile criminal act, provided such coverage meets Wikipedia's policies and guidelines on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\">+</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-addedline\"><div>==Sensationalism==</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td colspan=\"2\" class=\"diff-empty\">&#160;</td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\"><a class=\"mw-diff-movedpara-right\" title=\"Paragraph was moved.
